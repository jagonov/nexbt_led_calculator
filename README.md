# LED Video Wall Calculator
## Overview

The LED Video Wall Calculator is a web-based engineering tool designed to help system integrators, AV engineers, and designers accurately plan LED video wall deployments.

It converts high-level display requirements into detailed pixel, cabinet, control, network, and electrical specifications, reducing design errors and speeding up project estimation.

### Key Capabilities

#### When screen requirements are provided, the calculator generates:

   - Total pixel count

   - Final display resolution (W × H)

   - Total number of LED cabinets

   - LAN ports required

#### Recommended LED controller (based on selection)

#### Number of CO (Control Outputs)

#### Main breaker ampere-trip (AT) rating

### Visualization

The tool also provides a visual layout of the deployment, including:

Overall LED wall dimensions

Cabinet grid arrangement (rows × columns)

Cabinets connected per LAN port

Cabinets connected per CO

Logical distribution for signal and power planning

This visualization helps validate controller loading, signal limits, and physical layout before installation.

### How to Use

1. Open the calculator using the link below.

2. Enter the LED wall requirements:

   - Cabinet size

3. Review the automatically generated results:

   - Resolution and pixel totals

   - Cabinet count

   - Network and control requirements

   - Electrical breaker sizing

4. Use the visual layout to verify signal and power distribution.

### Electrical Assumptions

Unless otherwise stated, the calculator assumes:

Single-phase AC supply

Standard operating voltage (configurable if extended later)

Breaker sizing includes safety margin

Peak Power LED cabinet power consumption

Continuous operation load considerations

These assumptions are intended for preliminary engineering and estimation. Final designs should always be validated against manufacturer datasheets and local electrical codes.

### Intended Users

LED video wall system integrators

AV and broadcast engineers

Electrical designers

Project estimators and technical sales teams
